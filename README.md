Hello!

My name is Robatortas and I am an independent programmer.

I use Java as my main language.
JavaScript is my secondary language.

The projects I've done:

Other Words for Alone: A tile based videogame written entirely with java, no external libraries, and without much spoilers, it basically is a survival game planned to be procedurally generated in a near future. The game has a deep story involving love, health, death, hope, and many other hard subjects that make this game very different from the first looks it gives. Planned to be released before March of 2021.

CalculatorJE: This was the first GUI program I built. Its built to make basic mathematical operations with ease. With a minimalistic interface, it sure is a nice program to have on your Personal Computer. I rarely update it.

NotepadJE: This program is made for writing text files. Inspired by Microsoft's Notepad. This program serves its purpose and gives users ease while working, not as complete as the original Notepad, but has darkmode. :D

PONG: The first videogame I have published, I made a game before this one, but was never released. The concept is simple. You compete with the computer to try and not get the ball to get to your side. Based on Alan Alcorn's Pong, its a perfect combination between modernity, and nostalgia. Still being updated from time to time.

JRecognition: This program just started development, it's still on private use only for developers. This program allows you to train your computer to identify faces and objects with ease. With OpenCV's technology, it powers a wide range of possibilities in software security. This is currently being made for a school project. LMAO

TrexJS: This is a game that will be soon published. As the title indicates, its the famous Google's Trex game, made in JavaScript.
