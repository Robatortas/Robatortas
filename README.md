Hello!

My name is Robatortas and I am an independent programmer.

I work at Prolusio Interactive with my partner Skygallop.

I use Java as my main language.
JavaScript is my secondary language of choice.

The projects I've done:

Other Words for Alone: A tile based videogame written entirely with java, no external libraries, and without much spoilers, it basically is a survival game planned to be procedurally generated in a near future. The game has a deep story involving love, health, death, hope, and many other hard subjects that make this game very different from the first looks it gives. Planned to be released before March of 2021.

CalculatorJE: This was the first GUI program I built. Its built to make basic mathematical operations with ease. With a minimalistic interface, it sure is a nice program to have on your Personal Computer. I rarely update it.

NotepadJE: This program is made for writing text files. Inspired by Microsoft's Notepad. This program serves its purpose and gives users ease while working, not as complete as the original Notepad, but has darkmode. :D

PONG: The first videogame I have published, I made a game before this one, but was never released. The concept is simple. You compete with the computer to try and not get the ball to get to your side. Based on Alan Alcorn's Pong, its a perfect combination between modernity, and nostalgia. Still being updated from time to time.

JRecognition: This program is one of 3 I am making, designed to recognize facial expressions, it's a great tool to understand the basics of how face recognition actually works. Made for a school project.

TrexJS: This is the game we all know and love, the google Trex game, it doesn't have the complete features, but I will finish it whenever I feel like it. Built to replicate the original, it is a good way to spend some time while being bored.
