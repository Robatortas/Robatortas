## EXPERIENCE
My main language is Java, but I also use Javascript quite a lot.
CSS, HTML of course are other languages I use.

And soon I'll add more to this list.

(List is not very accurate...)

## GAMES
I make games most of the time, most of them are built with my own engine that I am developing called YURI ENGINE.

## OTHER STUFF
I sometimes make some really dumbass tools, others are not that dumb, I just make stuff that seems like fun or necessary for me to do something.

If you find something fun, use it as you please, I couldn't care less!
