### Biography
I mostly make computer games in my spare time as a way to enjoy my time.
And also computer applications.

I am also a workaholic! (idk if that's something to be proud of tho..)

I love talking about computers.
If a conversation doesn't have computers in it, I hate it.

My best interest is computer graphics, so I mostly develop games from the ground up.
Making engines is such a great thing!

### Please ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
Please browse some of my projects, I hope one of them can spark an interest in you.
