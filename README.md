Hello, I am Robatortas, and Im a little programmer trying to learn new things in java, im currently working on a lot of things, for example, I am making a sprite game.
I have made a Java Calculator, and PONG for Java, two small projects, and one project that I've never realeased, and probably wont.
so ye, I just make simple games. Im Indie I guess. I am looking up to making a good 2D sprite game in Java, so people get a little entertained, Almost everything will be made in Java.
I think that is it, if you would like to contact me (I dont think anybody will), but if you want to contact me for any reason, You can, just message me through github.
welp. guess I gotta continue making things.
