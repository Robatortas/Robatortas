### Hello!

My name is Robatortas and I am an independent programmer.

I work at Prolusio Interactive with my partner Skygallop.

### Knowledge
Java is my main language.

I can also work with JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

### Biography
I mostly make computer games in my spare time as a way to enjoy my time.
And also computer applications
I am also a workaholic!

I love talking about computers.
If a conversation doesn't have computers in it, I hate it.

My best interest is computer graphics, so I mostly develop games from the ground up.
Making engines is such a great thing!
